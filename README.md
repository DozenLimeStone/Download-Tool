# Download-Tool
Download Tool for Linux! Cool progress bar design, even cooler the file that you downloaded!
One issue is that it only supports links to files, anything else breaks the program, I still have to implement those respond headers...
That comes later.

Usage of program: you would pass one argument ( link to file ) and it would be downloaded.

Happy reading my code!
